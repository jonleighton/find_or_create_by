FindOrCreateBy
==============

Adds find_or_create_by and find_or_create_by! class methods to ActiveRecord::Base. Be aware of
the security implications, as the conditions are passed straight through to find, so an attacker
could potentially use this to retrieve arbitrary records from the database.

Example
=======

Person.find_or_create_by(:name => "Jon", :age => 20) # => Returns false if the record is not found and creation fails
Person.find_or_create_by!(:name => "Jon", :age => 20) # => Raises ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid if the record is not found and creation fails
